# Vault Contract Specification

This document explains the Soroban vault contract in practical terms for contributors who are new to the codebase.

The vault supports four core user flows:

1. A user deposits the `deposit_token`.
2. The contract tracks that user's vault balance.
3. An admin distributes rewards using the `reward_token`.
4. Users later claim their accrued rewards.

If you want the storage-level view first, read [contract-storage.md](/c:/Users/ADMIN/Desktop/remmy-drips/axionvera-network/docs/contract-storage.md).

## Contract Purpose

The contract acts like a token vault with lazy reward accounting.

- Deposits are tracked 1:1 in token units.
- Rewards are not pushed to every user immediately.
- Instead, the contract updates a global `reward_index`.
- Each user realizes their share when they interact again through `deposit`, `withdraw`, or `claim_rewards`.

This approach keeps reward distribution efficient because the contract does not need to iterate through every depositor.

## Storage Model Summary

The contract stores:

- global configuration: admin address, deposit token, reward token, initialization flag
- global accounting: `total_deposits`, `reward_index`
- per-user accounting: `user_liquid_balance`, `user_locks`, `user_reward_index`, `user_rewards`

See [contract-storage.md](/c:/Users/ADMIN/Desktop/remmy-drips/axionvera-network/docs/contract-storage.md) for the full storage breakdown.

## Reward Accounting Model

Rewards use an index scaled by `1e18`:

`reward_index += amount * 1e18 / total_deposits`

When a user interacts, the contract compares:

- the global `reward_index`
- that user's saved `user_reward_index`

The difference tells the contract how much new reward has accrued since the user's last interaction.

## Time-Locked Deposits

To incentivize long-term deposits, the vault supports time-locking funds. Users can lock a portion of their deposited assets for a configurable duration.

- **Locked funds are not withdrawable** until the lock period expires.
- **Locked funds continue to earn rewards** based on the standard reward index mechanism.
- The design includes support for future **reward multipliers** on locked funds, though this is not yet implemented in the reward calculation.

### Lock and Unlock Flow

1.  A user deposits funds, which are initially liquid.
2.  The user calls `lock(amount, duration)` to move funds from their liquid balance to a new lock.
3.  The lock has an `unlock_timestamp`. Before this time, the funds are inaccessible for withdrawal.
4.  After the timestamp passes, the lock is considered "expired".
5.  The `withdraw` function automatically processes expired locks, moving the funds back to the user's liquid balance before processing the withdrawal.
6.  Users can also manually trigger this process by calling `unlock_expired()`.

## Reward Accounting Logic

This section documents the critical "snapshot" mechanism that prevents reward stealing attacks in the index-based reward model.

### The Problem: Reward Stealing Attack

In an index-based reward system, if a user's balance changes without updating their `reward_index`, they can claim rewards they didn't earn. For example:

1. Global `reward_index` = 100
2. User deposits 1000 tokens (their `reward_index` = 100)
3. Admin distributes rewards, global `reward_index` = 200
4. User withdraws 1000 tokens **without updating their index**
5. User's pending rewards = 1000 × (200 - 100) / 1e18 = rewards they didn't earn

### The Solution: Snapshot Before Balance Change

The contract prevents this by **accruing rewards before any balance change**:

#### Deposit Flow

```
1. User calls deposit(amount)
2. Contract calculates pending rewards based on OLD balance
3. Contract stores accrued rewards in user_rewards
4. Contract updates user_reward_index to current global_reward_index
5. Contract increases user_balance by amount
6. Contract increases total_deposits by amount
```

**Why this order matters**: The user receives rewards only for the balance they held up to this point. The new deposit doesn't retroactively earn rewards.

#### Withdraw Flow

```
1. User calls withdraw(amount)
2. Contract calculates pending rewards based on OLD balance
3. Contract stores accrued rewards in user_rewards
4. Contract updates user_reward_index to current global_reward_index
5. Contract decreases user_balance by amount
6. Contract decreases total_deposits by amount
```

**Why this order matters**: The user receives rewards for their full balance up to withdrawal. After withdrawal, they can't claim rewards on the withdrawn amount.

#### Claim Flow

```
1. User calls claim_rewards()
2. Contract calculates pending rewards based on CURRENT balance
3. Contract updates user_reward_index to current global_reward_index
4. Contract resets user_rewards to 0
5. Contract transfers accumulated rewards to user
```

### Mathematical Verification

For a user with balance B and reward indices:

- `user_index` = last synced global index
- `global_index` = current global index

**Accrued rewards** = B × (global_index - user_index) / 1e18

This formula is applied **before** any balance change, ensuring:

- Rewards are calculated on the balance that earned them
- The index snapshot prevents double-counting
- Users cannot claim rewards for balances they don't hold

### Code Implementation

The core logic is in `storage.rs`:

```rust
fn accrue_position_rewards(
    state: &VaultState,
    position: &mut UserPosition,
) -> Result<(), VaultError> {
    if state.reward_index == position.reward_index {
        return Ok(()); // No new rewards
    }

    if position.balance > 0 {
        let delta = state.reward_index - position.reward_index;
        let accrued = position.balance * delta / REWARD_INDEX_SCALE;

        if accrued > 0 {
            position.rewards += accrued;
        }
    }

    position.reward_index = state.reward_index; // Snapshot the index
    Ok(())
}
```

This function is called in:

- `store_deposit()` - before increasing balance
- `store_withdraw()` - before decreasing balance
- `store_claimable_rewards()` - before transferring rewards

### Test Coverage

## Security Considerations

### Admin-Only Reward Distribution

The `distribute_rewards` function is a critical security-sensitive operation that:

1. **Requires Admin Authorization**: Only the admin address can call this function. The contract enforces `admin.require_auth()` to prevent unauthorized reward distributions.

2. **Minimum Amount Enforcement**: To prevent dust spam attacks, the function enforces a minimum distribution amount of **100,000 stroops** (0.0001 XLM). Any attempt to distribute smaller amounts will be rejected with `ValidationError::InsufficientRewardAmount`.

### Why Minimum Amount Matters

Without a minimum amount check, a malicious actor could:

- Spam small reward distributions to artificially inflate the `reward_index` calculation frequency
- Grief the network by forcing unnecessary state updates
- Waste gas on the Stellar network

The 100,000 stroop minimum:

- Prevents dust attacks while remaining accessible for legitimate admin operations
- Aligns with Stellar's native asset precision (1 stroop = 10^-7 XLM)
- Is small enough for testing but large enough to deter spam

### Function Signature

```rust
/// Distributes rewards to all depositors by updating the global reward index.
/// Does not immediately transfer rewards to users - they accrue lazily.
///
/// Security: Only admin can call this function.
/// Minimum amount: 100,000 stroops to prevent dust spam attacks.
pub fn distribute_rewards(e: Env, amount: i128) -> Result<i128, VaultError>
```

### Error Cases

| Error                      | Condition                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `NotInitialized`           | Vault not initialized      |
| `InvalidAmount`            | Amount is zero or negative |
| `InsufficientRewardAmount` | Amount < 100,000 stroops   |
| `Unauthorized`             | Caller is not the admin    |

The following tests verify this logic:

- `test_rewards_are_proportional_and_claimable` - Multiple users receive proportional rewards
- `test_reward_proportionality_with_unequal_deposits` - 1:2:3 deposit ratio yields 1:2:3 reward ratio
- `test_multiple_reward_distributions_accumulate` - Multiple distributions compound correctly
- `test_deposit_after_reward_distribution` - New depositors don't retroactively earn old rewards
- `test_reward_accrual_on_deposit_withdrawal_sequence` - Complex sequences maintain invariants

### Security Guarantees

1. **No Reward Stealing**: Users cannot claim rewards for balances they don't hold
2. **No Double-Counting**: Each reward is counted exactly once per user
3. **Atomic Updates**: Balance and index are always updated together
4. **Reentrancy Safe**: All state mutations happen within reentrancy guards

## Public Functions

### `version() -> u32`

Returns the contract version.

Why it exists:

- useful for integrations, upgrades, and quick sanity checks after deployment

Example:

```rust
let version = vault.version();
assert_eq!(version, 1);
```

### `initialize(admin, deposit_token, reward_token) -> Result<(), VaultError>`

Performs one-time setup for the contract.

What it does:

- stores the admin address
- stores the deposit token address
- stores the reward token address
- resets `total_deposits` and `reward_index` to `0`
- emits an `init` event

Security:

- Fails with `AlreadyInitialized` if called twice.
- Fails with `InvalidTokenConfiguration` if `deposit_token == reward_token`.
- Requires `admin` authorization.
  Important rules:
- can only run once
- requires `admin` authorization

Example:

```rust
vault.initialize(&admin, &deposit_token_id, &reward_token_id);
```

### `deposit(from, amount) -> Result<(), VaultError>`

Moves deposit tokens from the user into the vault and increases their recorded **liquid** vault balance.

Validations:

- `amount > 0`
- Requires `from` authorization
- Fails with `InsufficientBalance` if `from` does not hold enough `deposit_token`

Accounting:

- Accrues any pending rewards for `from` before changing their balance.
- Rejects invalid transfers before mutating user reward snapshots or vault balances.
  Step-by-step:

1. Confirms the contract is initialized.
2. Validates `amount > 0`.
3. Requires authorization from `from`.
4. Accrues any rewards already owed to `from`.
5. Transfers `deposit_token` from the user into the contract.
6. Increases `user_liquid_balance(from)`.
7. Increases `total_deposits`.
8. Emits a `deposit` event.

Why reward accrual happens first:

- the user should receive rewards based on their old balance up to this point in time
- only after that should the new deposit affect future distributions

Example:

```rust
vault.deposit(&user, &400);
assert_eq!(vault.balance(&user), 400);
assert_eq!(vault.total_deposits(), 400);
```

### `withdraw(to, amount) -> Result<(), VaultError>`

Moves deposit tokens from the vault back to the user from their **liquid** balance.

Step-by-step:

Validations:

- `amount > 0`
- Requires `to` authorization
- Fails with `InsufficientBalance` if `amount > liquid_balance(to)`
- Fails with `InsufficientContractBalance` if the vault cannot cover the token transfer

Accounting:

- Accrues any pending rewards for `to` before changing their balance.
- Final state is only written after token transfer pre-checks succeed.

1. Confirms the contract is initialized.
2. Validates `amount > 0`.
3. Requires authorization from `to`.
4. Accrues any rewards already owed to `to`.
5. **Processes expired locks for `to`**, updating their liquid balance.
6. Checks the user has enough **liquid** deposited balance.
7. Decreases `user_liquid_balance(to)`.
8. Decreases `total_deposits`.
9. Transfers `deposit_token` back to the user.
10. Emits a `withdraw` event.

Fails when:

- the amount is zero or negative
- the user tries to withdraw more than their **liquid** balance

Example:

```rust
vault.deposit(&user, &400);
vault.withdraw(&user, &150);

assert_eq!(vault.balance(&user), 250);
assert_eq!(vault.total_deposits(), 250);
```

**Exit Liquidity Guarantee**: This function is **isolated from reward claiming**. It handles only the deposit token and never touches the reward token. This ensures users can always withdraw their deposits even if the reward token contract fails or is paused.

### `distribute_rewards(amount) -> Result<i128, VaultError>`

Transfers reward tokens from the admin into the contract and updates the global reward index.

Step-by-step:

Validations:

- `amount > 0`
- Requires `admin` authorization
- Fails with `NoDeposits` if `total_deposits == 0`
- Fails with `InsufficientBalance` if `admin` does not hold enough `reward_token`

1. Confirms the contract is initialized.
2. Validates `amount > 0`.
3. Requires admin authorization.
4. Verifies `total_deposits > 0`.
5. Transfers `reward_token` from the admin into the contract.
6. Computes the reward-index increment.
7. Updates the global `reward_index`.
8. Emits a `distrib` event.
9. Returns the new `reward_index`.

Important behavior:

- this does not immediately transfer rewards to users
- it only updates global accounting so users can realize rewards later

Example:

```rust
let next_index = vault.distribute_rewards(&400);
assert!(next_index > 0);
```

### `claim_rewards(user) -> Result<i128, VaultError>`

Pays the user the rewards that have already accrued for them.

Step-by-step:

1. Confirms the contract is initialized.
2. Requires authorization from `user`.
3. Accrues any newly earned rewards into `user_rewards`.
4. Reads the current claimable amount.
5. Returns `0` immediately if nothing is claimable.
6. Resets `user_rewards(user)` to `0`.
7. Transfers `reward_token` from the contract to the user.
8. Emits a `claim` event when a transfer happens.

Validations:

- Requires `user` authorization
- Fails with `InsufficientContractBalance` if the vault reward pool is underfunded

**Isolation from Withdrawals**: This function is **completely separate from withdraw**. Users must call `claim_rewards` explicitly to receive their rewards. This design ensures:

1. **Exit Liquidity**: Users can always withdraw deposits via `withdraw()` even if reward claiming fails
2. **Reward Token Independence**: Failures in the reward token contract don't block deposit withdrawals
3. **Explicit Intent**: Users must actively claim rewards; they're not automatically bundled with withdrawals

Example:

```rust
let claimed = vault.claim_rewards(&user);
assert!(claimed >= 0);
```

**Recommended Usage Pattern**:

```rust
// Step 1: Withdraw deposits (always works)
vault.withdraw(&user, &amount);

// Step 2: Claim rewards separately (may fail if reward token has issues)
let rewards = vault.claim_rewards(&user);
```

This separation prioritizes **exit liquidity** over yield mechanics, ensuring users can always access their principal.

## Events

The contract emits standardized Soroban events for all state-changing actions. Events follow a consistent structure to ensure reliable off-chain indexing.

### Event Structure

All vault events use a **two-topic design** for efficient filtering:

- **Topic 1 (Protocol Identifier)**: `Symbol("AxionVault")` — Identifies the protocol namespace
- **Topic 2 (Action)**: Identifies the specific action (e.g., `Symbol("Deposit")`, `Symbol("Withdraw")`)
- **Data Payload**: Structured tuple containing event-specific data (user_address, amount, timestamp)

This design allows indexers to rapidly filter by:

- Protocol identifier for vault-specific events
- Action type for specific state changes

**Important**: Dynamic data such as user addresses and amounts are **stored in the data payload, not in topics**, because topic space is highly constrained on Soroban.

### Event: `Initialize`

**Topics:**

- Topic 1: `Symbol("AxionVault")`
- Topic 2: `Symbol("Initialize")`

**Data Payload (XDR Struct):**

```rust
struct InitializeEvent {
    admin: Address,
    deposit_token: Address,
    reward_token: Address,
    timestamp: u64,
}
```

**Description:** Emitted once when the contract is initialized with protocol parameters.

### Event: `Deposit`

**Topics:**

- Topic 1: `Symbol("AxionVault")`
- Topic 2: `Symbol("Deposit")`

**Data Payload (XDR Struct):**

```rust
struct DepositEvent {
    user_address: Address,
    amount: i128,
    timestamp: u64,
}
```

**Description:** Emitted when a user deposits tokens. The `amount` field contains the deposit quantity. The `timestamp` field is set from the ledger at event emission time.

### Event: `Withdraw`

**Topics:**

- Topic 1: `Symbol("AxionVault")`
- Topic 2: `Symbol("Withdraw")`

**Data Payload (XDR Struct):**

```rust
struct WithdrawEvent {
    user_address: Address,
    amount: i128,
    timestamp: u64,
}
```

**Description:** Emitted when a user withdraws tokens from the vault. The `amount` field contains the withdrawal quantity. The `timestamp` field is set from the ledger at event emission time.

### Event: `Distribute`

**Topics:**

- Topic 1: `Symbol("AxionVault")`
- Topic 2: `Symbol("Distribute")`

**Data Payload (XDR Struct):**

```rust
struct DistributeEvent {
    caller: Address,
    amount: i128,
    timestamp: u64,
}
```

**Description:** Emitted when an admin distributes rewards to the vault. The `amount` field contains the total reward tokens distributed. The `caller` field is the admin account. The `timestamp` field is set from the ledger at event emission time.

### Event: `Claim`

**Topics:**

- Topic 1: `Symbol("AxionVault")`
- Topic 2: `Symbol("Claim")`

**Data Payload (XDR Struct):**

```rust
struct ClaimEvent {
    user_address: Address,
    amount: i128,
    timestamp: u64,
}
```

**Description:** Emitted when a user claims their accrued rewards. The `amount` field contains the reward quantity claimed. The `timestamp` field is set from the ledger at event emission time.

### Indexer Integration

Off-chain indexers should:

1. **Subscribe to events with Topic 1 = `Symbol("AxionVault")`** to catch all vault events
2. **Filter by Topic 2** to identify specific actions (Initialize, Deposit, Withdraw, Distribute, Claim)
3. **Parse the data payload** to extract user_address, amount, and timestamp
4. **Build the user dashboard** by aggregating Deposit, Withdraw, Distribute, and Claim events chronologically

### XDR Serialization

Each event data payload is serialized as a Soroban ContractData XDR type. The indexer receives the full XDR envelope and must deserialize the data payload according to the struct definitions above.

Example (pseudocode):

```
event.topics[0] == Symbol("AxionVault")
event.topics[1] == Symbol("Deposit")
data = deserialize_xdr(event.data) as DepositEvent
// data.user_address, data.amount, data.timestamp are now available
```

## Errors

- `AlreadyInitialized`: vault initialization can only happen once.
- `NotInitialized`: the vault must be initialized before use.
- `InvalidAmount`: token amounts must be greater than zero.
- `InsufficientBalance`: the caller-facing token balance is lower than the requested amount.
- `NoDeposits`: rewards cannot be distributed while `total_deposits == 0`.
- `InvalidTokenConfiguration`: deposit and reward token addresses must be different.
- `InsufficientContractBalance`: the vault does not hold enough tokens to complete the transfer.
- `MathOverflow`: arithmetic overflow or underflow was detected while updating accounting.
  The contract can return the following errors from [errors.rs](/c:/Users/ADMIN/Desktop/remmy-drips/axionvera-network/contracts/vault-contract/src/errors.rs):

- `AlreadyInitialized`
- `NotInitialized`
- `Unauthorized`
- `InvalidAmount`
- `InsufficientBalance`
- `MathOverflow`
- `NoDeposits`

## Typical End-to-End Flow

1. Deploy the contract.
2. Call `initialize`.
3. User A deposits.
4. User B deposits.
5. Admin calls `distribute_rewards`.
6. Users inspect `pending_rewards`.
7. Users call `claim_rewards`.
